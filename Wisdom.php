        <h1>Wisdom for Life</h1>
		
		<h2>Theoretical Kabbalah Wisdom</h2>
		<p>The accompanying wisdom excerpts are drawn primarily from the realm of theoretical Kabbalah.</p>
		<p>They appear in no particular sequence or order.</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>True Love</h2>
		<p>To love is to give—freely and selflessly. True love is not measured by what one receives, but by the willingness to offer, to support, and to place the well-being of another above one's own desires. In its purest form, love seeks no reward; it finds fulfillment in the act of giving itself.</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Four Types of Love</h2>

		<h3>1. Love that depends on something – rooted in a shared interest:</h3>
		<p>A. Love based on a common interest, with conflicts – despite the fights, the relationship endures because of the shared interest.</p>
		<p>B. Love based on a common interest, without conflicts – the relationship is harmonious and sustained by mutual interest.</p>

		<h3>2. Love that does not depend on anything – not based on personal gain, but on the person themselves:</h3>
		<p>A. Incomplete love – sees only the good and overlooks flaws. This love is vulnerable and may fade when faults are discovered.</p>
		<p>B. Absolute love – endures even when flaws are revealed, such as a mother’s love.</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Giving and Receiving</h2>
		<p>Receiving can be a form of giving, and giving can be a form of receiving.</p>
		<p>When you give something to someone and they receive it with joy, you also receive—through the happiness their joy brings you.</p>
		<p>Likewise, when you receive with joy, you give joy to the one who gave.</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Principles for Life</h2>

		<p>Do not gossip—do not discuss friends or family members with other friends or family members.</p>
			
		<p>Do not blame others for negative events—especially acquaintances and everyday people. 
		This excludes politicians and world leaders who hold power and responsibility.</p>
		  
		   
		<p>Be humble. A humble person will not feel superior to others, 
		will not look down on anyone, will be patient, will not insist on his honor, 
		and will not be easily offended. He accepts every person with love and respect.</p>
			
		<p>Be a forgiving person.</p>

		<p>Be a happy person that others enjoy being around. 
		People who constantly complain or talk about their problems rarely 
		bring happiness to others—and are rarely happy themselves.</p>

		<p>Be careful not to be drawn into pride. 
		Any power, wisdom, wealth, or success a person has was given to them by God. 
		When one lives with this understanding, they move away from pride and grow in humility.</p>

		<p>Avoid honor and attention. 
		A person who wants to acquire humility should run away from honor, 
		not seek praise, and not be offended when he does not receive recognition.</p>
			
		<p>A person who sets aside their ego becomes a vessel for receiving the truth. 
		Ego blocks the ability to observe the truth.</p>
