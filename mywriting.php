        <h1>My Writing</h1>
		
 <h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>This writing is a work in progress and not yet finalized. I’ve uploaded it to my website so that family and friends—if they are interested—can read it while I continue refining it.</p>
		<p>This writing is not of original revelations, but rather my personal understanding and interpretation of Kabbalah, Judaism, and other philosophical schools of thought. Its sole purpose is to help people live a happy and healthy life in this world—and in other worlds or realms.</p>
		<p>If you come across spelling mistakes or find a better way to express something, I’d love to hear from you. I can’t promise to apply every suggestion, but I genuinely appreciate all feedback.</p>
		<p>If what’s written here doesn’t speak to you, that’s perfectly okay. You’re welcome to set it aside. In this writing, I do not claim to possess or know the truth.</p>
		<p>I simply wish to share the knowledge that has helped me immensely—knowledge I believe to be true and that has helped many others find peace and happiness.</p>
		<p>It is also important to say: merely knowing the truth and the principles of life is not enough. Happiness and health don’t come from knowing—they come from applying. And while applying these principles isn’t always easy, in my experience, they can be practiced and can lead to greater well-being, peace, and joy.</p>

		<h2>The Source of All</h2>
		<p>We live in a material world governed by certain principles. When we know and live per these principles, we create happiness and well-being for ourselves and for those around us. It becomes evident that there is not only a material world but also a spiritual, non-material realm.</p>
		<p>The more one understands the truths of both the material and spiritual worlds, the calmer, healthier, and more joyful one becomes. Agony, suffering, and pain can exist when one is far from the truth. The path to happiness and health lies in coming closer to the truth.</p>
		<p>We may come to the realization that there is one Source from which all things originate. Some call it God; others use different names. But names can sometimes create misunderstanding or limit our thinking, especially when shaped by past beliefs or painful experiences.</p>
		<p>This Source includes everything: the material universe, all beings, the spiritual worlds, good and evil alike. All things, both living and non-living, are part of the Source—and the Source is everything.</p>
		<p>Let us begin with the assumption that the Source contains all truth. The closer one aligns with the truth—of both material and spiritual realms—the more one is in control of their life. And the more control one has, the more they will experience health, happiness, and freedom from suffering.</p>
		<p>We might call the Source “the Infinite.” It gives infinite light, which can be defined as infinite giving, infinite love, infinite forgiveness, and infinite joy. But this light is not the Source itself. The Source creates and emits the light. The light is the pleasure we all strive for—and it can be used by both the good or the evil. Evil can use this light to deceive or trap a person.</p>
		<p>The Source has no desire to receive. It has no ego, no self-importance, no need for self-esteem. The Source has everything—and is everything. And when you are everything, you have no need to receive or to seek.</p>

	<h2>The Realms</h2>
		<p>Imagine a scale or ladder—a way to picture how close or far someone is from the Source. This scale is not physical. It’s a metaphor for a person’s state of mind and spiritual condition.</p>
		<p>The closer one is to the Source, the more one experiences goodness, light, and joy. The farther one is, the more one experiences darkness, confusion, and suffering. This is how we can understand Heaven and Hell. They are not just places—they are states of mind. It is possible to dwell in a physical body on Earth and feel either in Heaven or in Hell.</p>

		<h2>The One</h2>
		<p>A person is, at their core, a “desire to receive.” Everything we do is driven by the intention to gain something. People seek many things, and each person is drawn to different desires in different degrees.</p>
		<p>Some common desires include: Pride, honor, respect, validation, confidence, approval, love, belonging, security, control, recognition, freedom, wealth, money, luxury, fame, power, success, career achievement, high social status, influence, beauty, youthfulness, health, strength, sexual attraction, vitality, and comfort.</p>
		<p>The Source, however, has no “desire to receive”—none of these. The Source only gives. The more one clings to selfish desires, the further they move from the Source. The more one desires to give and help others, the closer one is to the Source.</p>
		<p>One might ask, “But how can I just give? I also need things for myself.” When one desires something, they should consider that they need it in order to help and provide for others—just as one earns a living to support their family or community.</p>
		<p>Another example: One eats to stay healthy and strong in order to continue providing for and being present with their family. Eating solely for the sake of pleasure is not aligned with the good—it distances you from the Source.</p>
		<p>One should also always be satisfied with what they have. In their mind, one can think: “I receive this so that I may give—so that I may help my family, my friends, and others.”</p>

	<h2>Lasting Joy</h2>
		<p>The happiness and pleasure that come from achieving things for oneself are always temporary. People often continue to chase more, trying to extend that fleeting feeling of satisfaction. We’ve all seen examples of people who have everything—wealth, fame, power—and yet feel empty. Despite seemingly having it all, something essential is missing.</p>
		<p>True and lasting joy comes from giving. Helping others brings a happiness that remains.</p>

	<h2>Principles for Life</h2>

	<p>Do not gossip—do not discuss friends or family members with other friends or family members.</p>
		
	<p>Do not blame others for negative events—especially acquaintances and everyday people. 
	This excludes politicians and world leaders who hold power and responsibility.</p>
      
	   
	<p>Be humble. A humble person will not feel superior to others, 
	will not look down on anyone, will be patient, will not insist on his honor, 
	and will not be easily offended. He accepts every person with love and respect.</p>
		
	<p>Be a forgiving person.</p>

	<p>Be a happy person that others enjoy being around. 
	People who constantly complain or talk about their problems rarely 
	bring happiness to others—and are rarely happy themselves.</p>

	<p>Be careful not to be drawn into pride. 
	Any power, wisdom, wealth, or success a person has was given to them by God. 
	When one lives with this understanding, they move away from pride and grow in humility.</p>

	<p>Avoid honor and attention. 
	A person who wants to acquire humility should run away from honor, 
	not seek praise, and not be offended when he does not receive recognition.</p>
		
	<p>A person who sets aside their ego becomes a vessel for receiving the truth. 
	Ego blocks the ability to observe the truth.</p>
